\section{Web}
The web part could be tested very well with \textbf{\textit{https://www.hardenize.com}}. This is by the way the same tool/website with which the email part was checked.
\newline To test the ``before'' part properly, an nginx had to be installed on the server in advance. It was not included by default on the servers used for testing. 
This is primarily about showing what it looks like when an unconfigured web service is on the internet versus made more secure with the script from this project.
