\section{More Hardening} \label{more_hardening}
After installing all components with the script, you have a decent hardened server. Still, it could be more secure! There are things we could not configure for you in this project like: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item TLS 1.3 : An update of TLS 1.2, faster and more secure. \newline
	For more information about TLS 1.3, please check a the comparative study paper (TLS1.2vs1.3.pdf) from our colleges Kandiah Rajina and Doukmak Anna. You can find the PDF in the same directory. 
	\item \gls{DNSSEC} : To secure your domain, but it needs some interaction with your top-level domain registrar.
	\item E-Mail
	\subitem \gls{MTA-STS}: For more security in sending and receiving emails.
	\subitem \gls{DANE}: (needs DNSSEC) is a bridge between DNSSEC and TLS.
\end{itemize}
As well we would have liked to provide you some more components like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item XMPP-IM \gls{WebRTC}: For real-time communication.
	\item \gls{Tor} Node: For growing the Tor network.
	\item Snort-IDS: For network intrusion detection and prevention.
    \item \gls{WAF}: To add an existing layer of security to the webserver. Especially when the webserver acts as an application server.
\end{itemize}
All of those are candidates for future work. It may be done in a second project from our university... or you?
