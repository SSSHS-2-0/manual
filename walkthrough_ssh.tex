 \subsection{Configuration}
 This is an example of the \gls{SSH} configuration part, all inputs are highlighted in yellow.
 \subsubsection{User management ssh}
 Here is a minimal example for the ssh user handling, for further information see section \ref{user_management} 
 \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside=||]
<SSH> - Mon Jan 14 09:44:29 UTC 2019 - Perform actions on SSH
<SSH> - Mon Jan 14 09:44:29 UTC 2019 - Perform install on SSH
<INFO> - Mon Jan 14 09:44:29 UTC 2019 - Doing user handling for SSH configuration
Usage:
        This function helps you manage the users on this system and select the ones you wish to provision for the ssh service.
        Following actions are available:
                help:           Display this help
                display:        Show all unix users on this system
                add:            Add a unix user to this system (this implies the select action)
                delete:         Remove a unix user from this system (this implies the unselect action)
                select:         Add a existing unix user to the list of users which will be provisioned for the service ssh
                unselect:       Remove a user from the list of users which will be provisioned for the service ssh
                show:           Show the list of users which will be provisioned for the service ssh
                quit:           Exit this function

\subsubsection{SSH key generation}
For every user a personal ssh key-pair is generated, the user has to enter the passphrase.
When the setup is complete the user can download all his keys, certificates and passphrases from the server.

\subsubsection{SSH hardening \& cleanup}
At the end the user keys are moved to the corresponding user home and the SSH configuration is hardenend \cite{ssh-hardening}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Root login is not permited
\item Passwort login is not permited
\item X11 is not permited
\item Only secure alogrithms are permited
\end{itemize}
