IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.examplerun.cf/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.examplerun.cf/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2019-04-14. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot renew"

 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.

 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

 \subsubsection{Dovecot configuration}
 Dovecot acts as the \gls{IMAP} server to enable clients to fetch mail from the server. 
The authentication is done via client certificates. 
At the end the generated certificates for the user can be downloaded over a secure SSH connection. This includes:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item{Dovecot \gls{SSL} (letsencrypt)}
     \item{Authentication via certificates}
     \item{Preparation of artifacts (ZIP file with certificates) and download command}
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{E-Mail process diagram}
Here we have process diagram of how the script works with all possible outcomes.

\subsection{Multiple e-mail addresses}
With the user management you can create multiple users. All of them will get their own mail address. In this version of the script it is not possible to have multiple mail addresses per user. See subsection \ref{future_work_mail}.
