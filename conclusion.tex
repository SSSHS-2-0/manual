\chapter{Conclusion}
Every user who exchanges information over the internet should have the privilge to do this in a secure an anonymous matter. We built this script to provide every user, a maximal secure server, with a minimal need of information. Altough we tried to cover as much aspects and components as possible we saw, during our work, that there is much more to do. The further work which could build on top of our project are written down in chapter \ref{future_work}. After all, we learnt a lot for the future and are hoping to make the internet a little more secure for everyone of its users.
