\section{Code Migration}
Our script collection is exclusively implemented with bash. So we are close to the operating system and can directly fall back on commands of the operating system.
Using other scripting languages or perhaps even a high-level language (object-oriented) would probably be a pay off.
With code migration it is always a kind of 'trade off' between what one likes, becoming more modern and/or simplifying.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \gls{Python}:
	\subitem Also close to the linux operating system. Certain subrutienes would be simpler or smaller in python and in general python is better readable and therefore easier to maintain. 
	\item \gls{Ansible}:
	\subitem A very good example of modernization and machine independence. Ansible is very contemporary and migration to one or more ansible playbooks from our code would certainly be possible.
\end{itemize}
When it comes to code migration, it must be mentioned that the primary focus is not on creating new code parts, but on refactoring and migrating existing code. Of course, you can create new code in parallel, but you won't be able to avoid rewriting or moving existing code.
