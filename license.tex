For all the work accomplished in this project we were inspired by a lot of resources. Especially by the book \enquote{Linux Hardening in Hostile Networks: Server Security from TLS to Tor} \cite{rankin17}, which provided a lot of examples for our work. Furthermore a lot of very well written websites and online guides were used: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Dovecot and Postfix client certificate authentication \cite{mail-auth}}
    \item{DMARC Setup \cite{mail-dmarc}}
    \item{Configuring HTTPS servers \cite{nginx-ssl}}
\end{itemize}

Nevertheless we paid close attention not to copy any code nor modify any of the components we use. Therefore all the outcome we produced in this project is our own work.

We decided to use the MIT license which has a wide acceptance in the open source community and fits our needs for license without warranty.
